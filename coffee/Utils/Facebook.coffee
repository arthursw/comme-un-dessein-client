# the callback you provide.  They can be:

# 1. Logged into your app ('connected')
# 2. Logged into Facebook, but not your app ('not_authorized')
# 3. Not logged into Facebook and can't tell if they are logged into
#    your app or not.

# Load the SDK asynchronously

# Here we run a very simple test of the Graph API after login is
# successful.  See statusChangeCallback() for when this call is made.
